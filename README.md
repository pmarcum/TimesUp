# TimesUp
A Google Sheet giving a simple timer. Enter the time for the "alarm" to go off. The alarm is a cell showing "TIME IS UP!" that turns red. 
This little tool was intended to keep proposal review panels on-schedule and prevent going down a rabbits hole and spending too much time
on a given proposal, as the panel has to finish its review within a limited time. 

The link to the Google Sheet (which works completely using Google Sheet commands in the cells and does not require an attached script) is here: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1DP3CBREP6lo6KME5rtwQ_mj1RY-9pxcFotQuPTzw0R0/copy

Hit the "Copy" button that appears when you select the above link, which will make a copy of this spreadsheet at the top of your folder hierachy
in your Google Drive (e.g., in "My Drive"). The copy is then yours to use as you wish. Move the spreadsheet down into whatever folder you 
wish.

Of course, this tool can be used for anything -- not just a proposal review meeting!
