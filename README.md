# TimesUp
A Google Sheet providing a simple count-down timer showing number of hours, minutes and seconds remaining. Enter the time for the "alarm" 
to go off. The alarm is a cell showing "TIME IS UP!" that turns red. This little tool was intended to keep proposal review panels 
on-schedule and prevent going down a rabbits hole and spending too much time on a given proposal, as the panel has to finish its review 
within a limited time. 

The link to the Google Sheet (which works completely using Google Sheet commands in the cells and does not require an attached script) is here: 
https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1UTHtPB9Ls9-K4KJdBVqevZUZMVS0PVmX4OQpN1qkHDg/copy

Hit the "Copy" button that appears when you select the above link, which will make a copy of this spreadsheet at the top of your folder hierachy 
in your Google Drive (e.g., in "My Drive"). The copy is then yours to use as you wish. Move the spreadsheet down into whatever folder you 
wish.

Of course, this tool can be used for anything -- not just a proposal review meeting!

UPDATES:
-------------------------------------------------------------
Aug 12, 2023: Completely re-wrote the entire spreadsheet to allow a time duration to be specified, rather than the clock time, to designate how long
the count-down should be.  Also added a "pause" feature.  Now, you enter the number of minutes (or hours) that you want to be count-down, and click the "start" checkbox to initiate the countdown.  If you want to pause the clock, check the "pause" checkbox (leaving the "start" checkbox still checked).  When you want the clock to continue, check the "pause" box to uncheck it.  If you want to start all over again, to refresh the clock, you just toggle the "start" box (e.g., unselect it, then select it again).
